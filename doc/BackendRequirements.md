# Backend Requirements

docker

Note:
You must have running ChromaDB and Ollama services running (locally or externally), and configure their URLs/Ports in [ChatbotServices.php](../php/ChatbotServices.php) as needed.

The [server](../server/) folder has a [docker-compose.yml](../server/docker-compose.yml) file to get those services running locally if you do not have an external server running them.
